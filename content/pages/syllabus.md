Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

This subject provides an introduction to fluid mechanics. You will be introduced to and become familiar with all relevant physical properties and fundamental laws governing the behavior of fluids and you will learn how to solve a variety of problems of interest to civil and environmental engineers. While there will be a chance for you to put your mathematical skills obtained in MIT courses 18.01, 18.02, and 18.03 to use in this subject, the emphasis is on physical understanding of why a fluid behaves the way it does. The aim is to make you think as a fluid. In addition to giving you a working knowledge of fluid mechanics, the subject will prepare you for higher-level subjects in fluid dynamics.

### Lectures

Lecture notes will be distributed for each lecture, usually covering "theoretical" aspects (derivations, etc.) in more detail or in a different manner than done during class or in text. The subject content is defined by the material presented in {{% resource_link 6439f51f-7325-c3ea-129c-1205b94ea80d "lecture notes" %}}, {{% resource_link ee18de12-ed45-b384-7a83-72aa73f66dd1 "recitations" %}}, and {{% resource_link 4acfe29a-6d77-d741-c878-fc255ec71209 "readings" %}}, so regular attendance is advisable.

### Recitations

Recitations will illustrate and/or expand on concepts presented in lectures by working through example problems or conducting simple experiments. Material covered in recitations is often related to homework assignments and is considered part of the subject content, so regular attendance at one of the two weekly recitations is advisable.

### Text

The following book will be used as the text for the subject, supplemented by lecture notes:

Young, Donald F., Bruce R. Munson, and Theodore H. Okiishi. _A Brief Introduction to Fluid Mechanics_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: Wiley, 2003. ISBN: 0471457574.

Reading assignments are given in the {{% resource_link 4acfe29a-6d77-d741-c878-fc255ec71209 "readings" %}} section.

### Homework

Problem sets will be distributed at regular intervals. Each problem set is designed to build upon the material covered in the preceding lectures. Homework assignments will be prepared by teams consisting of three students. Each team will hand in one solution, with the names of team-members who contributed indicated on the cover-page. Due dates for problem sets are **firm** and homework assignments will be corrected and handed back (with solutions) no later than two lectures after the due date.

### Exams

There will be three in-class hour exams. There will also be a three-hour scheduled final exam. The exams will be closed-book, but "cheat-sheets" will be handed out.

### Grade

The grade will be based on:

In arriving at a final letter grade, two grades will be given:

1.  a grade based on all assignments and exams, and
2.  a grade based on the best 7 of 9 homework assignments, best 2 of 3 in-class exams, and the final exam.

The better of the two grades will be your final letter grade in 1.060.
